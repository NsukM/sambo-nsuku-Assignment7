# Kanban Board Explanation

## What is a Kanban Board?

A Kanban board is a visual project management tool that organizes tasks into workflow stages using columns such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done." It helps teams visualize progress and manage workload efficiently.

## How My Board Works

- *Visual Workflow:* Columns represent task states: Backlog, In Progress, Testing, Blocked, and Done.
- *WIP Limiting:* I aim to keep only 2–3 tasks per person in the In Progress column to avoid multitasking overload.
- *Agile Support:* The board supports sprint execution, visual feedback loops, and quick adaptation to changing requirements.
