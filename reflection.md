## Challenges Encountered

The main challenge was selecting a GitHub template that supported automation while being flexible enough for sprint planning. Initially, the Basic Kanban seemed easy to use, but I realized it lacked automation. After testing, I found that the Automated Kanban template offered the best balance of simplicity and productivity.

Customizing the board required careful consideration of how the new columns would fit into the development lifecycle. I added "Testing" and "Blocked" to better reflect tasks during sprint execution.

## Tool Comparison

- *GitHub Projects:* Works best for developers who already use GitHub. It integrates Issues, automation, and @mentions, making it ideal for coding-focused workflows.
- *Trello:* Simple and flexible, but lacks native GitHub integration and automation features.
- *Jira:* Powerful for enterprise use, but has a steep learning curve and overhead for smaller teams.

## Lessons Learned

This assignment helped me understand how to implement Agile methods using GitHub Projects. I learned how to manage sprints visually and the value of WIP limits and task status visibility for a productive team workflow.
