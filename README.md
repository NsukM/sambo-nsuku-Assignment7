## Kanban Board Customization

This project uses the *Automated Kanban* template to manage development tasks using Agile principles.

### Custom Columns Added:
- *Testing*: To verify tasks/features before completion.
- *Blocked*: To flag tasks that are stuck due to dependencies or issues.

### Features Implemented:
- Linked Issues from Assignment 6 were added and categorized as bug, feature, or enhancement.
- Each task was assigned using @mentions.
- The board automatically moves issues between columns based on their state (e.g., Closed issues move to Done).

The board enhances visibility, accountability, and continuous feedback.
