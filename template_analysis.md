## Justification for Chosen Template

I selected the *Automated Kanban* template for my project because it integrates seamlessly with GitHub Issues, supports Agile sprints, and includes automation that reduces manual task updates. The automatic movement of issues based on their status helps maintain an up-to-date workflow, aligning well with the iterative nature of Agile development.
